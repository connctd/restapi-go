# DEPRECATED

This repo is now integrated into the connector-go SDK at https://github.com/connctd/connector-go. Please use the SDK instead and update your dependencies.
The models defined in `actions.go` can now be found at https://github.com/connctd/connector-go/blob/main/messages.go in the module. Models defined in `things.go` can be found at https://github.com/connctd/connector-go/blob/main/models/things.go.
